        <h2>üï∂Ô∏è Part II: The Bloodline of Shadows</h2>
        <P>
            <h3>After the Fall</h3>
            The night the Marcellos died, Duncan stood in the ashes of their once-glorious empire ‚Äî warehouses burned, safehouses raided, names crossed off lists. The city felt hollow without the old codes. Every man he once trusted was either buried, flipped, or running scared.
            For weeks, he disappeared. No calls, no movement, no word. Just whiskey, ghosts, and silence.
            But vengeance has a way of keeping men alive.
            He began digging ‚Äî not in the dirt, but through whispers. Following the money, tracing the blood trails. The deeper he went, the clearer the picture became: Antonio‚Äôs killer wasn‚Äôt just some rival thug ‚Äî it was a coordinated betrayal that reached *international*. Someone higher had ordered the hit.
            The Marcello downfall was just one piece of a global reshuffle in the underworld.

            <h3>The Rising Sun</h3>
            His hunt led him to <b>Tokyo</b>, where he found work under a mid-level Yakuza boss named 
            <br>**Ryuji Sato**. Duncan wasn‚Äôt trusted at first ‚Äî a foreigner with a gangster‚Äôs stare and an American accent. But Ryuji saw something in him: focus, discipline, and quiet rage.
            The Yakuza didn‚Äôt operate like the Marcellos. They were ritualistic ‚Äî about honor, order, and silence. Duncan respected that. He learned their customs, observed their code, and earned his way into their trust.
            They taught him precision.
            He taught them efficiency.
            Over the years, he became Ryuji‚Äôs *kaikei-nin* ‚Äî an advisor and enforcer who handled international business where traditional Yakuza couldn‚Äôt tread. His mix of Western ruthlessness and Eastern discipline made him an asset.
            But even in Japan, the whispers of the Marcello betrayal followed him. Every connection, every black-market deal brought him closer to the truth ‚Äî the hit on Antonio was funded through **Triad channels**.

            <h3>The Dragon‚Äôs Web</h3>
            Hong Kong.
            That‚Äôs where Duncan‚Äôs hunt took him next.
            He infiltrated the **Sun On Hei Triad**, under the leadership of an old-school boss named **Li Shen**, a man who valued loyalty above blood. Duncan offered his services ‚Äî logistics, weapons, and connections back in the States. Li Shen didn‚Äôt trust him at first, but Duncan didn‚Äôt need trust. He needed access.
            Over time, Duncan climbed again ‚Äî from outsider to strategist. His name started to carry weight in underground circles across Asia. People whispered about *the foreign ghost with the eyes of a killer* who brokered deals no one else could.
            But the truth finally surfaced: the man who financed Antonio‚Äôs death was a **Triad-affiliated financier**, using the chaos in Los Santos to eliminate rivals and open new smuggling routes.
            Duncan didn‚Äôt hesitate.
            He found him.
            And he ended him.
            Not quickly. Not cleanly. But personally.

            <h3>Return of the Reaper</h3>
            After that night, Duncan walked away from the Triads. Not out of fear ‚Äî out of fulfillment. His vengeance was complete, but the man he‚Äôd become was something else entirely.
            He had absorbed every culture, every code ‚Äî Italian loyalty, Japanese discipline, Chinese strategy. Together, they shaped him into something new: not a gangster, not an assassin, but a **ghost in the hierarchy of global crime**.
            He returned to Los Santos under a new name ‚Äî **Black Dragon** ‚Äî gathering those who lived by the old codes. Men and women who‚Äôd lost their families, their flags, their honor.
            From the ashes of betrayal rose a new brotherhood ‚Äî **The Black Dragon Syndicate** ‚Äî part Yakuza, part Mafia, part Triad, built on one rule:
            Loyalty above blood.

            <h3>Present-Day Duncan</h3>

            Now, Duncan Smokey operates in the shadows once more ‚Äî older, sharper, quieter. His empire doesn‚Äôt flaunt power; it moves in silence. From drug routes to arms deals, from contracts to diplomacy, Duncan keeps order where chaos used to rule.

            He‚Äôs no longer chasing ghosts.

            He *is* the ghost ‚Äî the shadow that keeps the underworld in balance.
