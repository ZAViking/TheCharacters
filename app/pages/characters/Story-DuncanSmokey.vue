      <h2>Duncan Smokey – The Ghost of the Old Family</h2>
      <p>Born in the backstreets of Los Santos’ slums, **Duncan Smokey** never had the luxury of innocence. His father died overseas—a soldier who believed in honor and flags that never believed in him. His mother, left alone and broken, did what she had to do to keep them alive. It left Duncan with a bitter taste for the world and a lesson burned deep into his soul: *nobody saves you but yourself.*
        As a boy, Duncan worked any job that paid. He shined shoes outside the docks, ran messages for drunks, and eventually, carried “packages” for men who didn’t ask questions. Those men were part of a local crime family—the **Marcellos**—a name whispered with both fear and respect. Duncan was just a street rat to them at first. But he watched. He learned. He listened. Every errand was a lesson. Every beating he saw was a reminder of what power looked like.
        Over the years, he proved himself. Reliable. Quiet. Efficient. He didn’t talk too much; he *did*. The streets started calling him **Smokey**—because he appeared, handled business, and vanished before the dust settled. Soon enough, the Marcellos took notice.
        They made him an associate, testing him with small-time collections and protection gigs. He excelled. When others hesitated, Duncan acted. When others panicked, Duncan kept calm. And after a few years, when he handled a bloody ambush single-handedly and protected one of the family’s capos, he was finally “made.”
        He wasn’t just part of the life—he *was* the life.
        But nothing gold ever stays.
        The Don, **Antonio Marcello**, a man who treated Duncan like the son he never had, was ambushed one night. A meeting gone wrong. A setup. Duncan was supposed to be there—but fate had other plans. By the time he arrived, it was too late. Antonio was dead. The family fractured, the hierarchy crumbled, and old allies turned on each other like vultures.
        Now, Duncan lives in the shadows of that broken empire. The family he built his life around is dust. The streets he bled for have forgotten his name. But he hasn’t forgotten **the one who pulled the trigger**. He’s chasing whispers, following blood trails, piecing together lies.
        Each city he drifts through, each deal he takes, brings him closer to the truth—and to the man who stole his only father figure.
        They say Duncan Smokey died when the Marcellos fell.
        But the truth is—he’s just getting started.</p>

        <h2>🕶️ Part II: The Bloodline of Shadows</h2>
        <P>
            <h3>After the Fall</h3>
            The night the Marcellos died, Duncan stood in the ashes of their once-glorious empire — warehouses burned, safehouses raided, names crossed off lists. The city felt hollow without the old codes. Every man he once trusted was either buried, flipped, or running scared.
            For weeks, he disappeared. No calls, no movement, no word. Just whiskey, ghosts, and silence.
            But vengeance has a way of keeping men alive.
            He began digging — not in the dirt, but through whispers. Following the money, tracing the blood trails. The deeper he went, the clearer the picture became: Antonio’s killer wasn’t just some rival thug — it was a coordinated betrayal that reached *international*. Someone higher had ordered the hit.
            The Marcello downfall was just one piece of a global reshuffle in the underworld.

            <h3>The Rising Sun</h3>
            His hunt led him to <b>Tokyo</b>, where he found work under a mid-level Yakuza boss named 
            <br>**Ryuji Sato**. Duncan wasn’t trusted at first — a foreigner with a gangster’s stare and an American accent. But Ryuji saw something in him: focus, discipline, and quiet rage.
            The Yakuza didn’t operate like the Marcellos. They were ritualistic — about honor, order, and silence. Duncan respected that. He learned their customs, observed their code, and earned his way into their trust.
            They taught him precision.
            He taught them efficiency.
            Over the years, he became Ryuji’s *kaikei-nin* — an advisor and enforcer who handled international business where traditional Yakuza couldn’t tread. His mix of Western ruthlessness and Eastern discipline made him an asset.
            But even in Japan, the whispers of the Marcello betrayal followed him. Every connection, every black-market deal brought him closer to the truth — the hit on Antonio was funded through **Triad channels**.

            <h3>The Dragon’s Web</h3>
            Hong Kong.
            That’s where Duncan’s hunt took him next.
            He infiltrated the **Sun On Hei Triad**, under the leadership of an old-school boss named **Li Shen**, a man who valued loyalty above blood. Duncan offered his services — logistics, weapons, and connections back in the States. Li Shen didn’t trust him at first, but Duncan didn’t need trust. He needed access.
            Over time, Duncan climbed again — from outsider to strategist. His name started to carry weight in underground circles across Asia. People whispered about *the foreign ghost with the eyes of a killer* who brokered deals no one else could.
            But the truth finally surfaced: the man who financed Antonio’s death was a **Triad-affiliated financier**, using the chaos in Los Santos to eliminate rivals and open new smuggling routes.
            Duncan didn’t hesitate.
            He found him.
            And he ended him.
            Not quickly. Not cleanly. But personally.

            <h3>Return of the Reaper</h3>
            After that night, Duncan walked away from the Triads. Not out of fear — out of fulfillment. His vengeance was complete, but the man he’d become was something else entirely.
            He had absorbed every culture, every code — Italian loyalty, Japanese discipline, Chinese strategy. Together, they shaped him into something new: not a gangster, not an assassin, but a **ghost in the hierarchy of global crime**.
            He returned to Los Santos under a new name — **Black Dragon** — gathering those who lived by the old codes. Men and women who’d lost their families, their flags, their honor.
            From the ashes of betrayal rose a new brotherhood — **The Black Dragon Syndicate** — part Yakuza, part Mafia, part Triad, built on one rule:
            Loyalty above blood.

            <h3>Present-Day Duncan</h3>

            Now, Duncan Smokey operates in the shadows once more — older, sharper, quieter. His empire doesn’t flaunt power; it moves in silence. From drug routes to arms deals, from contracts to diplomacy, Duncan keeps order where chaos used to rule.

            He’s no longer chasing ghosts.

            He *is* the ghost — the shadow that keeps the underworld in balance.
