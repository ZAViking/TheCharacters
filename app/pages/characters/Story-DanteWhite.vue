        <h2>🏍️ Part III: The Renegade’s Redemption</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>The Weight of Shadows</h3>
            <p>
                For years, Duncan Smokey ruled the underworld from the dark — respected, feared, and untouchable. But when you’ve dealt with devils long enough, they start to remember your name.
                Contracts he’d signed, alliances he’d broken, and enemies he’d made all came calling at once.
                The **Triads wanted retribution** for the man he executed.
                The **Yakuza saw him as a liability** for walking away.
                And in Los Santos, the **police were hunting him** for half a decade’s worth of blood and smoke trails.
                The Black Dragon Syndicate had become a myth — and myths always leave survivors who want revenge.
                So Duncan did what he always did best — disappeared.
                He burned everything.
                The name *Duncan Smokey* died that night.
                And in his place, a new man was born.
            </p>

            <h3>The Rebirth – Dante White</h3>
            <p>
                He called himself **Dante White** — a name simple enough to blend in, clean enough to start fresh.
                He drifted north, laying low in the outskirts, working as a mechanic, a courier, anything that paid cash. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was peace — something Duncan hadn’t felt in decades.
                But peace doesn’t sit well with a man like him.
                When a group of bikers rolled through town — patched members of a newly **reborn MC**, promising brotherhood and loyalty — Dante saw a spark of the old days. A sense of order, family, and purpose.
                He patched in quietly, never telling anyone who he really was. For a while, it felt right — the long rides, the bar fights, the brotherhood. He fixed bikes by day and ran jobs by night. But the deeper he went, the more he saw it: corruption, ego, betrayal — the same poison that killed the Marcellos and the Syndicate.
                They talked about loyalty, but lived for greed.
                Dante had seen this story before. He knew how it ended.
            </p>

            <h3>The Silverbacks</h3>
            <p>
                He left before it all collapsed.
                No blood, no noise — just silence.
                A few months later, fate brought him across the **Silverbacks MC** — a rough, old-school club that wasn’t about fame or money. They lived by the road, by the code, and by their bond. They didn’t ask questions about his past — they just watched his actions.
                And in time, he earned their respect.
                Among the Silverbacks, **Dante finally found something real**. They weren’t soldiers or gangsters — they were brothers. The kind of men who bled for each other, no politics, no power games. It wasn’t about hierarchy; it was about honor.
                He wasn’t Duncan the Made Man anymore.
                He wasn’t Smokey the Ghost.
                He was **Dante White** — a rider, a brother, a man rebuilding his soul one mile at a time.
            </p>

            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>
                Even with a new name, the past never forgets.
                There are still people out there who whisper Duncan Smokey’s name like a curse. Some want him dead. Others want him back. But those who truly know him? They say the man died long ago — and what’s left is a living legend hiding under leather and dust.
                When asked about his past, Dante only says one thing: “I’ve been loyal to ghosts before. Now, I ride with the living.”
            </p>

            <h3>Quote</h3>
            <p>
                “You can change your name, your face, your life… but the ghosts? They ride with you, no matter where you go.”
                “I stopped looking for power. Now I just look for peace — and brothers who won’t stab me in my sleep.”

        <h2>🏍️ Part IV: Brothers of the Road</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>The Road Finds the Lost</h3>
            <p>
                By the time Dante White crossed paths with the **Silverbacks Motorcycle Club**, he’d already buried three lifetimes.
                The mafia had taken his youth.
                The syndicates had taken his soul.
                The hunt for revenge had taken his peace.
                He didn’t join the Silverbacks looking for redemption — he joined because he was tired of running.
                And for once, the road didn’t ask for his past.
                They found him outside a rundown garage on Route 68, sleeves rolled up, fixing a Harley that wasn’t even his. He wasn’t trying to prove anything. But to men like the Silverbacks — real bikers, not posers — actions speak louder than words.
                Their president, **Reed “Bulldog” Cavanaugh**, watched him for a while before asking,
                “You ride hard?”
                “Hard enough,” Dante said, without looking up.

                That was the beginning.
            </p>

            <h3>The Patch and the Code</h3>
            <p>
                The Silverbacks weren’t saints — far from it. They ran guns, moved shipments, and kept their own kind of justice. But they weren’t reckless. They believed in **old-school brotherhood**, in loyalty earned through fire, not words.
                Dante started as a **Hangaround**, watching and learning.
                Then came **Prospect** — long nights on guard duty, rides in the rain, jobs no one else wanted.
                But he never complained. Never bragged. Never broke.
                When he finally got patched in, Bulldog handed him his cut personally — black leather, silver trim, and a single motto stitched under the emblem:
                “Honor Rides Forever.”
                That night, they rode out deep into Blaine County — no music, no talking, just the sound of engines and the open sky. For the first time in years, Dante felt it again — belonging.
            </p>

            <h3>Brothers Before Blood</h3>
            <p>
                The Silverbacks weren’t about money or empire. They were about *each other*.
                When one went down, the rest stood up. When one got locked up, the rest paid the lawyer.
                For Dante, this was what the Marcellos and the Syndicate could never give — real family.
                Not built on fear, but **respect**.
                Not on bloodlines, but **brotherhood**.
                He became the **enforcer** — the calm, silent figure everyone respected. When things went bad, he was the one Bulldog sent in first.
                Not to talk.
                To finish.
                But Dante had changed. He no longer killed for money. He only drew his gun for family.
                Every time he pulled that trigger, it was for someone who’d stand in front of him without question.
            </p>

            <h3>War and Loyalty</h3>
            <p>
                It wasn’t long before the Silverbacks found themselves at war with a rival club — the **Iron Hounds MC**.
                The Hounds were chaos: younger, hungrier, and too reckless to live long.
                They wanted territory. The Silverbacks wanted peace.
                When the Hounds hit a Silverback convoy one night, Dante was there. Three brothers went down. Two didn’t make it. The next day, Bulldog didn’t have to ask. Dante was already loading up the bikes.
                What followed wasn’t a battle — it was a message.
                By the time the smoke cleared, the Hounds were done.
                The Silverbacks didn’t lose another man after that.
                That night, Bulldog raised a glass to Dante and said,
                “You might’ve changed your name, brother. But I know who you are.
                he road’s forgiven you. Time you forgive yourself.”
            </p>

            <h3>Peace on the Asphalt</h3>
            <p>
                Years later, Dante still rides with the Silverbacks.
                His name — *Duncan Smokey* — is a ghost of the past.
                His legacy — the blood, the power, the vengeance — all gone with the wind.
                Now, he rides for something simple.
                Freedom. Brotherhood. Honor.
                He keeps the same lighter in his cut pocket — the one engraved with **A.M.** for Antonio Marcello.
                Not as a weight of guilt, but as a reminder of where he came from… and how far he’s come.
